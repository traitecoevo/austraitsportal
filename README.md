# austraits.portal

The goal of austraits.portal is to create a code-free interface for
users to access the AusTraits Plant Trait database. The portal is live
at

**<https://app.austraits.org/austraits/>**

> **Note:** the portal is now hosted on AWS at the address above. The
> previous ShinyApps deployment
> (`https://unsw.shinyapps.io/austraits-portal/`) is deprecated.

For programmatic (code-based) access to the same data, use the
[`austraits`](https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits) R package.

## Using the portal

The portal provides a code-free, point-and-click interface for exploring
and downloading AusTraits data — no R or programming required. To get
started, open **<https://app.austraits.org/austraits/>** in a web browser
and:

- **Browse and filter** the data using the controls in the sidebar. You
  can narrow the data by taxonomy (family, genus, species), by trait, by
  geographic location, and with custom filters.
- **Preview results** in the interactive data table, which updates as you
  adjust filters. Columns are sortable and the table paginates through
  matching records.
- **Explore taxa and traits** via the dedicated Taxon View and Trait View
  tabs, which show species profiles, trait summaries, trait definitions,
  distributions, and maps.
- **Query by URL** — filter states can be shared via links, e.g.
  `?taxon_name=Eucalyptus+globulus`, `?trait_name=leaf_area`, or
  `?tab=Trait+View`.
- **Download** the filtered data for your own analysis, along with the
  matching citations shown in the Citations tab.

The sections below are for developers who want to run, prepare data for,
or deploy the portal.

## About AusTraits

The AusTraits database is a comprehensive collection of plant trait data
for Australian flora. It includes measurements of various traits such as
leaf area, plant height, seed mass, and more, collected from a wide
range of sources including published literature, field studies, and
herbarium records. The database is designed to support research in
ecology, evolution, and conservation by providing standardized trait
data for Australia’s 30,000 plant species.

The AusTraits Data Portal offers an additional interface to explore and
download data from the AusTraits database, complementing our primary
access point, versioned releases on
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15718081), most easily accessed via
the [`austraits`](https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits) R package.
As detailed on Zenodo, AusTraits has been released under an open source
licence (CC-BY 4.0), enabling re-use by the community.

The database exists because of data submitted by more than 300
contributors from across Australia and the world. Without their efforts
to collect, curate and contribute their data, AusTraits could not exist
and we express our gratitude to all researchers and institutions who are
part of the AusTraits Project. The project is jointly led by Dr Daniel
Falster (UNSW Sydney), Dr Elizabeth Wenk (UNSW Sydney), Dr Rachael
Gallagher (Western Sydney University), and Dr Hervé Sauquet (Royal
Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust Sydney)

## To open the data portal locally

``` r
pkgload::load_all()

shiny::shinyApp(ui = app_ui, server = app_server)
```

However, note that app relies on creation of data files.

By default, only a small dataset is included in the repo. To use the
full dataset, you will need to download the latest version of the
AusTraits database and prepare it for use in the portal (see below).

## Data Preparation

### Lite version

The portal is designed to work with two versions of the AusTraits
database: a “lite” version containing a subset of core traits for
demonstration purposes, and a “full” version containing all available
traits and observations.

The lite version is included in the repository at
`inst/extdata/austraits/austraits-5.0.0-lite`. To prepare this data for
use in the portal, run the following code:

``` r
austraits:::austraits_5.0.0_lite |>
  prepare_data_for_portal("inst/extdata/austraits/austraits-5.0.0-lite", overwrite = TRUE)
```

To prepare the full version of the data,run the following code to
prepare it for use in the portal

``` r
austraits_7.0.0 <-
  austraits::load_austraits(version = "7.0.0", path = "inst/extdata/austraits", update = FALSE)

# A small fix for Austraits v7.0.0 (to be deleted in future versions) - some datasets have missing source_primary_key values, which causes problems for the portal. This code fills in missing values for the Bryant_2021 dataset, which is the only one affected.
austraits_7.0.0$methods <- austraits_7.0.0$methods |>
  mutate(
    source_primary_key = ifelse(grepl("Bryant_2021", dataset_id), dataset_id, source_primary_key)
  )

austraits_7.0.0 |>
  prepare_data_for_portal("inst/extdata/austraits/austraits-7.0.0-full", overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Deploying to shinyapps.io (deprecated)

> **Note:** the portal is now served from AWS at
> <https://app.austraits.org/austraits/>. The ShinyApps deployment
> described below is deprecated and retained for reference only.

App was deployed at <https://unsw.shinyapps.io/austraits-portal/> with
configuration details stored at
`rsconnect/shinyapps.io/unsw/austraits.portal.dcf`.

To update deployment, open in RStudio and run:

``` r
rsconnect::deployApp()
```

Dependencies are managed via the file `manifest.json`. To update
dependencies, run:

``` r
rsconnect::writeManifest()
```

Note that successful installation requires that the `austraits.portal`
package itself first be installed from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/austraits.portal@develop")
```

## App Design Overview

### Architecture

The AusTraits Data Portal is built as a modular Shiny application
inspired by the {golem} framework. The application provides an
interactive interface to explore and download trait data from the
AusTraits database.

#### Core Components

**Data Layer** - **Storage**: Data stored as Parquet files for efficient
querying - **Query Engine**: DuckDB in-memory database for fast
filtering and aggregation - **Two Datasets**: - Raw observations
(individual measurements) - Species averages (aggregated means per
species) - **Arrow Integration**: Arrow datasets registered with DuckDB
for zero-copy data access - **Precomputed Metadata**: Cached trait
definitions, dropdown values, and flora links for fast access (via
`prepare_data_for_portal`).

**UI Structure** (`app_ui.R`) - **Sidebar**: Filtering controls via
`mod_filters_ui` - **Main Panel**: Tabbed interface with 5 views: - Data
Preview (`mod_data_table`) - App Information (`mod_app_info`) - Taxon
View (`mod_taxon_view`) - Trait View (`mod_trait_view`) - Citations
(`mod_citations`)

**Server Logic** (`app_server.R`) - Reactive data flow coordinating
filters, queries, and display - Debounced filtering to reduce
computational overhead - Lazy data loading (100 rows initially, load
more on demand) - Cached computations using `memoise` for performance

### Key Modules

| Module             | Purpose                | Key Features                                   |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **mod_filters**    | User filter controls   | Taxonomy, traits, location, custom filters     |
| **mod_data_table** | Interactive data table | Sortable, paginated, DT with truncated cells   |
| **mod_taxon_view** | Taxon profile pages    | Species info, trait summary, external links    |
| **mod_trait_view** | Trait profile pages    | Trait definitions, distributions, maps         |
| **mod_citations**  | Citation information   | Dynamic reference generation for filtered data |
| **mod_app_info**   | Portal documentation   | Usage guide, attribution, telemetry metrics    |

### Data Processing Pipeline

1.  **Filter Parsing** (`fct_filter_parsing.R`)
    - Converts UI inputs into structured filter objects
    - Validates and normalizes filter values
2.  **Filter Application** (`fct_filter_application.R`)
    - Applies filters to DuckDB queries
    - Optimized single-pass filtering
    - Supports regex patterns for text searches
3.  **Query Execution**
    - Initial load: First 100 rows for display
    - Background: Count total matching rows
    - On-demand: Load additional batches as needed
4.  **Data Display**
    - Format columns for presentation
    - Generate interactive visualizations
    - Cache expensive computations

### Performance Optimizations

- **DuckDB**: High-performance analytical queries on Parquet files
- **Lazy Loading**: Only loads visible data (100 rows at a time)
- **Memoization**: Caches repeated computations (trait groups, dropdown
  values)
- **Debouncing**: Delays filter execution until user input settles
  (300-1000ms)
- **Precomputed Dropdowns**: All filter options cached at startup
- **Efficient String Matching**: DuckDB’s optimized regex for filtering

### Data Preparation

The `prepare_data_for_portal()` function (in `fct_prepare_data.R`)
processes the raw AusTraits database for portal use:

- Flattens nested database structure
- Computes species-level averages for core traits
- Exports to Parquet format (display and full versions)
- Generates cached metadata (definitions, sources, trait groups,
  dropdown values)
- Pre-processes flora links and state/territory distributions

### Telemetry

Optional analytics tracking via Supabase or local SQLite: - Session
starts - Search events (when filters applied) - Download events -
Displayed in real-time on App Information tab

### URL Parameters

The app supports deep linking via URL query parameters: -
`?taxon_name=Eucalyptus+globulus` - `?trait_name=leaf_area` -
`?tab=Trait+View` - All filter states can be encoded in URLs for sharing
